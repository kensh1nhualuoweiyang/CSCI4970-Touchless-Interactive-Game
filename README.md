# Touchless Interactive Game

CSCI 4970 Capstone Project

Authors:
Dillon Damme, Chen Su, Joseph Wright

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This application is intended to be used in doctor's offices waiting rooms or similar places as a way to entertain children. More specifically, it is intended to be a touchless experience. That is, the children do not have to physically touch anything which prevents the spread of germs. The application utilizes a webcam to capture image data and then use that image data to transform the video feed in various entertaining ways. For example, a child could stand in front of a monitor with a webcam and the child's image could be shown back to them upside down, as a different color, distorted, etc. 

In order to use this application, you can use a service such as the live server extension in Visual Studio Code. To do this, you need to install the Live Server extension, right click on the index.html file in this project, and click 'Open with Live Server'. A browswer window will then open and webcam access will be requested. Clicking 'allow' will start the application. 

Alternatively, the project is hosted at https://reverent-shockley-09506a.netlify.app/ so you can use the app there. Additionally, pressing any key on the keyboard will advance the effect. Otherwise the effects change every few seconds.
